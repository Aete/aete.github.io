                <h4>Objective</h4>
                <p>In this project, we wanted to make urban design tool that gives designer not only digital experience,
                    but also analogue(sense of touch, tactile) experience.</p>
                <p>In design process, we do not communicate with each other through the mouse. People usually
                    communicate with moving, turning, and tearing things with a pencil, pen, and hand. It is very
                    inspiring way.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, for urban design (or large-scale buildings), it is essential to understand contact
                    as well as appearance. Sometimes the physical, social and economic contexts determine most of the
                    design of the site and buildings. </p>
                <p>What we wanted to create was a digital tool that could show the various contexts of cities and a
                    platform in which many participants could evolve esign by doing things with their hands. Using AR
                    technology, User checks entire shape and context of urban environment in digital display, and
                    modifies by moving and changing QR markers </p>

                <h4>Process</h4>
                <p>Programming Language : Processing</p>
                <p>QR City is simple program that detects QR markers in given image and creates buildings according to
                    makers' position and pattern.
                    Programming code was written in Processing, and we used OpenGL, NYAR4PSG, and GSvideo processing
                    libraries</p>
                <p>We set every marker(1-100) has its own building information(usage, height, and etc.). Different
                    color(red, yellow and etc.) means different usage.</p>
                <img src="image/qrcity1.jpg">
                <p> The program detects the markers on the webcam and displays the unique building by calculation. Users
                    can erase QR-markers and background when they finish.</p>

                <h4>Possibility</h4>
                <p>We thought that ‘QR City’ could be developed as sustainable urban design tool, if there were any
                    related data to use. For example, it could be developed for 'zero energy neighborhood' design tool
                    with information about energy consumption of buildings and amount of sunshine. </p>
                <p>If we use data such as water, waste, and traffic, program can be developed as powerful tool for
                    designing sustainable urban environment.</p>
