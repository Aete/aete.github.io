<p>Planning corridor between dwelling units as a specific program for
   living, working and playing</p>
<p>The corridor in the apartment has been used as a space for mobility without
    any programs. In this project, we suggested making entire of building as an urban ecosystem of
    'Live, Work, Play' through utilizing the abandoned corridors</p>

<h3>Wall Design Detail</h3>
<p>There are two wall modules for different usages. Type A (thickness : 100mm) is for an inner wall of
   the dwelling unit, and Type B (thickness : 200mm) is for an exterior wall of the dwelling unit. Wall
   Modules are combined with profiles.</p>

<h3>#1. Buy the space</h3>
<p>Residents buy floor space as much as they need, and later, they can buy or sell more space as
   needed.</p>
<img src="image/dwelling/scene-1.jpg">
<p>Facilities and structures are provided as fixed elements, and the rest of
    the walls are freely configurable by the residents.</p>

<p>Space is organized according to residents' preferences with wall modules provided. Wall modules are
    provided in a variety of types, such as storage, doors, and windows.</p>

<h3>#5. Expansion of the Boundaries</h3>
<p>The first floor, which is the boundary between the building and the outside, consists of several
    programs for sharing with neighbors from the outside such as car sharing, community room, and open
    exhibition <br/>
    In addition, at the rooftop garden, events for the town such as film festivals
    are held.</p>
